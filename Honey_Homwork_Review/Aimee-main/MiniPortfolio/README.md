# 🧩 Mini Portfolio — HTML Learning Goals

This project is designed to teach **core HTML structure and semantics** before adding JavaScript.

By building this one-page mini portfolio, you will learn how real websites are structured using **only HTML and CSS-ready markup**.

---

## 📌 What You Will Learn

### 1️⃣ How a Real HTML Page Is Structured

You will learn how every HTML page starts and why each part exists:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` and why it matters
- `<html lang="en">` and accessibility
- The difference between:
  - `<head>` (page settings)
  - `<body>` (visible content)

---

### 2️⃣ How Metadata Works

You will understand what these tags do and **why they are important**:

- `<meta charset="UTF-8">` for text and symbols
- `<meta name="viewport">` for mobile responsiveness
- `<title>` and how it appears in the browser tab
- `<link>` to connect CSS to HTML

---

### 3️⃣ Semantic HTML (Meaningful Tags)

You’ll learn to use HTML tags **based on purpose, not appearance**:

- `<nav>` for navigation
- `<main>` for primary page content
- `<section>` for grouped, themed content
- Why semantic tags matter for:
  - readability
  - accessibility
  - SEO

---

### 4️⃣ Page Layout Using Sections

You will build a full one-page layout using sections:

- Hero / introduction section
- Projects section
- About section
- Contact section

Each section will:

- Have a clear role
- Use headings correctly (`h1`, `h2`, `h3`)
- Be easy to style later with CSS

---

### 5️⃣ Headings and Content Hierarchy

You’ll learn that headings are **not just sizes**, but structure:

- `h1` → main page title
- `h2` → section titles
- `h3` → subsection titles

This teaches how browsers and screen readers understand your page.

---

### 6️⃣ Text Content and Inline Elements

You’ll practice:

- Writing readable content with `<p>`
- Highlighting specific words using `<span>`
- Understanding the difference between:
  - block elements (sections, paragraphs)
  - inline elements (span, links)

---

### 7️⃣ Navigation with Anchor Links

You’ll learn how internal links work:

- Using `<a href="#section-id">`
- Connecting navigation links to sections
- Creating smooth one-page navigation

---

### 8️⃣ Lists for Structured Content

You’ll use:

- `<ul>` and `<li>` for navigation menus
- `<ul>` and `<li>` for contact links

This shows how lists are used beyond just bullet points.

---

### 9️⃣ Media with Figure and Figcaption

You’ll learn how to correctly group images and descriptions:

- `<figure>` for self-contained content
- `<img>` for displaying images
- `<figcaption>` for image descriptions

This is a professional and semantic way to display project cards.

---

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Read and understand HTML page structure
- Build a clean one-page layout from scratch
- Use semantic tags correctly
- Prepare HTML that is ready for styling and JavaScript

---

- CSS layouts and themes
- Responsive design
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Multi-page websites
